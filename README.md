This is a repo for a helpful prototype for a coop OS
This idea is inspired by urbit and farcaster and hopefully will grow into something bigger than both of them
It's a social network, and an app for managing coops
People are assumed to have two things a micro server (wall outlet server), and a daily driver (laptop)
it:
- allows access to a coop only social network
- house specific management functions
	- Rent payment
	- Groccery request
	- Meeting POAP
	- Dynamic meeting notes
	- Recruitment management 
	- House Wiki
	- Alumni community
	- Sublet management
- Inter House community building (tied in with the coop social network)
	- Event Hosting
	- Multi-House Groccery optimization
	- Member meetup facilitation
	- House page central lookup
	- House-Housemate matching
	- Coop Creator - Collaborator Matching
