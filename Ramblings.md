Let's think of the UX of this app, the social network function should be like nouns x farcaster x shrubbery. That sounds like scope creep so let's think about what mvp would look like
## MVP thoughts

Should the mvp target coops or people first? Coops I think.
So first functions I think would be api enabled note taking app that interfaces with finances, recruiting, and groccery ordering, ideally extensible.

- Finances (to start hopefully change latter)
  - Brex wrapper 

- Food (to start hopefully change later)
  - Instacart wrapper

- Recruiting (this one will change the most later) 
  - Directory SF

- Note Taking (this needs to be bespoke to work correctly)
  - Kinda like notion meets farcaster frames


## How to bridge this to CoopOS social network??

I think the route is for the group chat that most houses run on to be extensible into a framework of federation somehow need to figure out the technical details but I don't want mastodon type network, I want urbit like network. Maybe this is the way first get people to have the little mico servers in their room, and the houses to have a box in the living room then have several of the house go in on a shrine (server publicus) in a park. 

How to get this behaviour to emerge? I understand the benefits on the coop house level(better org and tooling), and on the inter coop house level(groccery, recruiting, social net) but not yet on the person already in a coop level(needs a sell). There is clear benefits for the person not in a coop house (find houses, other ppl to make a house with, be a part of a scene, etc).
