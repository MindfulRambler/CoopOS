Let's think of the UX of this app, the social network function should be like nouns x farcaster x shrubbery. That sounds like scope creep so let's think about what mvp would look like
## MVP thoughts

Should the mvp target coops or people first? Coops I think.
So first functions I think would be api enabled note taking app that interfaces with finances, recruiting, and groccery ordering, ideally extensible.

- Finances (to start hopefully change latter)
  - Brex wrapper 

- Food (to start hopefully change later)
  - Instacart wrapper

- Recruiting (this one will change the most later) 
  - Directory SF

- Note Taking (this needs to be bespoke to work correctly)
  - Kinda like notion meets farcaster frames
